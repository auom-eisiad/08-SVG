# SVG Logo Maker

![Screenshot](/images/wesbite.png)

## Description

The goal of this application is to allow the user to easily create a simple and easy SVG logo based on their input through a series of prompts using the command-line. By taking in the user's input, the command line application will generate a SVG logo. Through this activity, I was able to learn how inquirer and jest works, and how to retrieve the data from the prompts.

## Installation

All installations should already be installed but if the required packages are missing, please reinstall in this order depending on which package you are missing:

`package.json:` npm init -y 

`node:` npm i 

`inquirer:` npm i inquirer

`jest:` npm i jest

`color:` npm i color

## Usage

To run this application, you will need to go into your terminal and type in "node index.js" into the command line. You will then be prompted to answer some questions regarding what kind of logo you would like. Once you are done answering all the questions, the generator will create a logo.svg file within the "examples" folder. In order to view your logo, just click and drag the file on a browser of your choice.
